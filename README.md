<h3> About</h3>


Shane Muirhead helped me get my logging system working correctly, i couldnt have gotten this done without his rewriting of my code
He has also helped me out on getting my recipespage.html working but helping me get the code right. the coding he helped me get right
was the part that selects what recipe the user wishes to see in the recipespage.html, the section at the bottom of this page were 
you can view other recipes. everytime i got help from shane, he has pointed out that my code was close and just needed adjusting to make
it work thus the code in my project is mine but rewritten by shane in some area's.

another part he helped me with was the session stuff, he helped me get my page to save the username from the login form as session name so that the site knows who is logged in.
this also lead to help getting the session name set as author name when a recipe is added to the site, in this part he explained it would be easier to write the 
dictionary for the form instead of having the route do it for me. this also allowed me to set approval to no when the form was pushed to mongodb.
